# Clipster 📋
Clipster is an easy to use and powerful ios shortcut app for managing text clipboards easily!

## Overview
My first ever “proper” ios shortcut
  
I created this shortcut because it's hard to find a free clipboard manager on ios that's not littered with ads, so I decided to create one for myself
